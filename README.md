# How to Implement a First-Order Low-Pass Filter in Discrete Time

We often teach or learn about filters in continuous time, but then need to implement them in discrete time (e.g., in code) on data acquired at discrete sample times.  This notebook shows one way to design and implement a simple first-order low-pass filter in discrete time.  The example is written in Python and uses [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org).
